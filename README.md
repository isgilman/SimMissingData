# SimMissingData
#### Simulation and analysis of quartet-based species trees using RADseq libraries with varying levels of missing data
You can find a walkthrough of the dataset simulations and analyses using SVDquqrtets in the Jupyter Notebook `SimMissingData.pynb`. The same datasets will be used in the analyses using ASTRAL-II, which can be found in `working_on_it.ipynb`

## Simulations
Datasets were simulated in Python using *simRRLs* and *PyRAD* (Eaton 2014). Species trees estimated with a single-site method, SVDquartets (Chifman and Kubatko 2014) via PAUP\* (Swofford 2003) and a summary method, ASTRAL-II (Mirarab and Warnow 2015).
