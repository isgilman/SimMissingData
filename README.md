# SimMissingData
#### Simulations and data analysis for simulation RADseq datasets with varying levels of missing data

## Simulations
Datasets were simulated in Python using *simrrls* and pyRAD (Eaton 2014), and species trees estimated with SVDquartets (Chifman and Kubatko 2014) via PAUP\* (Swofford 2003).

## Analysis
Analysis of resulting trees was also conducted in Python using DendroPy.
